# TimeSeriesSTD

This project applies the Box-Jenkins methodology (SARIMA) and other advanced time series analysis methods to a dataset containing annual STD cases from 1996 to 2014. By employing techniques such as differencing, spectral analysis, and stationarity tests, I aimed to uncover significant patterns and trends within the data. The SARIMA model was identified as the most suitable for forecasting, revealing an increasing trend in STD cases over the years. My findings highlight the potential for these methods to provide valuable insights into public health data, guiding future interventions and resource allocation.
